# Integrations and widgets

An **integration** is one configured connection to a service: an address and
credentials. A **widget** shows one view of it on a board. Many widgets can
share one integration; the server asks the service once per widget interval
and caches identical requests for a few seconds.

Every adapter lives in one file under `backend/app/adapters/`. It declares
its connection fields, its widgets, and how to fetch, act and fake data.
The frontend never knows a service: every widget returns a `WidgetData`
that one of thirty-one renderers draws.

## Adapters in 0.12.0

| Adapter | Widgets | Actions | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker | containers, summary, load, logs | start, stop, restart, pause, resume | socket or TCP |
| Proxmox VE | node, guests, summary | start, shutdown, reboot | API token |
| Portainer | containers, summary | container actions | access token |
| Nomad | jobs, nodes, cluster | stop a job, scale a task group up or down | none on a cluster without ACLs, else an ACL token with node:read and namespace:read-job; the buttons need namespace:scale-job or namespace:submit-job |
| Cup | image updates, updates waiting | check now | none; Cup has no sign-in, so its port stays inside the network |
| Coolify | applications, deployments, status | | API token; the API has to be switched on in Coolify |
| Gitea, Forgejo | open issues or pull requests, Actions jobs, repositories | | access token with read access to repositories, issues and the user |
| Semaphore UI | last runs, automation | | API token of a user; the cards see the projects that user sees |

| Synology DSM | system, volumes, disks, containers, vms | start, stop, restart; power on, shut down, reboot | user and password; containers and VM details through DSM's own interface calls |
| Unraid | system, array, guests | | API key (GraphQL) |
| Nextcloud | overview, active users, free space | | serverinfo token, or an administrator account |
| TrueNAS | system, pools, alerts | | API key; use https, where a Read-Only Administrator is enough; over http only a TrueNAS before 25.04 is read, with a full administrator's key, because later versions deprecate the REST API that http is limited to |
| Proxmox Backup Server | datastores, host, tasks | | API token; DatastoreAudit on /datastore and Sys.Audit on /system |
| Kopia | snapshots, backups | | the server's user and password; the CSRF token of its start page is fetched and kept |

| Syncthing | folders, status | | API key |
| Backrest | backup plans, backups | back up a plan now | user and password of Backrest's own sign-in, or nothing when it is switched off |
| Komodo | stacks, deployments, overview | restart a stack | API key and secret of a user, best a service user, with Read on stacks, deployments and servers and Execute on a stack to restart it; Komodo 2 |
| Netdata | raised alerts, load per node, alerts | | none; the agent's API is open, and a parent answers for every node that streams to it |
| Ollama | loaded models, installed models, models | unload a model | none; Ollama has no sign-in, so its port stays inside the network |
| Open WebUI | users, models, accounts | | API key of an administrator from Settings > Account > API keys; API keys have to be switched on in the admin settings, they are off by default |
| Watchtower | last update run | run now | API token (WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN), with metrics and update switched on in WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_ENDPOINTS; the maintained fork nickfedor/watchtower |

| nexpulse | latest result (a running test live, a button to start one), history (speed or ping idle and under load), period summary, recent tests, latency under load (graded A+ to F) | | API key from nexpulse under Settings > API keys; a key that may only read fills every card, one with "Read and start tests" adds the button. nexpulse 0.1.1 or newer tells nexdeck which kind of key it is; on 0.1.0 the button is always shown |
| Traefik | overview, routers | | none, or basic authentication |
| Nginx Proxy Manager | proxy hosts, certificates, status | | an account; the token is fetched and kept |
| OPNsense | system, gateways | | API key and secret |
| pfSense | system, interfaces | | API key of the package pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI |
| MikroTik | system, interfaces | | user with the read policy; needs RouterOS 7 with the REST service on |
| FRITZ!Box | connection, line | | none; TR-064 on port 49000, the part of it that answers without credentials |
| Tailscale | devices, status | | API access token from the admin console |
| Headscale | nodes, status | | API key from `headscale apikeys create` |
| wg-easy | WireGuard clients, VPN | | user and password; wg-easy 15 or newer |

| Shlink | short URLs, visits | | API key from `shlink api-key:generate` |
| Blocky | blocking, top blocked | pause 5 min, enable | none; Blocky's API has no sign-in, so its HTTP port stays inside the network, and statistics.enable has to be on (Blocky 0.35 or newer) |
| Gatus | endpoints, endpoint health | | user and password of security.basic, or nothing when Gatus has no security section |
| NetAlertX | new devices, offline devices, devices | mark as known | API token from Settings > General, sent to the API port (20212); save the settings once so the token stays the same |
| Pocket ID | recent sign-ins, users | | an administrator's API key from Settings > API keys, or STATIC_API_KEY; without a browser, a login code from `pocket-id one-time-access-token` opens the session that makes a key |
| Reolink | cameras, camera (snapshot or live video), findings | | user and password of a device account; HTTP or HTTPS switched on in the device's port settings |
| Frigate | cameras, detections, status | | none on port 5000, the internal API; a user and a password on port 8971, the authenticated one, and behind a proxy in front of it. A viewer is enough. The token is fetched and kept |
| Plex | now playing, library, libraries, recently added (covers), findings, server load, users and devices, top of the week, music player | scan a library; play music in the browser, make and change playlists (smart ones stay read-only) | Sign in with Plex (PIN at plex.tv fills token and server address), or the owner's token |
| Jellyfin, Emby | now playing, library, libraries, recently added (covers), findings, users and devices, top of the week, music player | scan every library (one alone does nothing on these, measured); play music in the browser, instant mixes, make and change playlists | API key |
| Nexview | requests, library, instances, requests to approve | approve with target folder and profile, turn down | API key; approving needs an approver's key that may write |
| nexmail | unread mail (total and per mailbox, a mailbox whose sign-in fails is marked), latest mail (sender and subject, unread ones highlighted, each row opens the message in nexmail) | | API key from nexmail 0.17.0 or newer under Settings > API keys, with the mailboxes shared on it; the latest mail card needs the scope "Count, sender and subject" and is not offered for a key that may only count. The operator of nexmail has to allow API keys first |
| Seerr | requests, counts | approve, decline | API key |
| Overseerr, Jellyseerr | requests, counts | approve, decline | API key; same API as Seerr, listed under their own names |
| Tautulli | now playing, streams, most watched | | API key |
| RomM | platforms, recently added games, game library | | client API token with roms.read and platforms.read |
| Immich | archive, storage, users | | API key of an administrator |
| Bazarr | status, missing subtitles, recently fetched | | API key |
| Audiobookshelf | library, listening now | | API key |
| Navidrome | library, playing now | | account; the Subsonic API signs each request with a salted token |
| Komga | library, recently added | | API key, or the account on older versions |
| Kavita | library, recently added | | API key; the token is fetched once and kept |
| Calibre-Web | library, recently added | | account; it has no API, so the address of its own table view is used |
| Tdarr | queue, nodes | | optional API key |
| Unmanic | workers, queue | | none |
| FileFlows | status, running | | optional access token |
| Maintainerr | collections, status | | none |
| Jellystat | libraries, most watched | | API key |

| SABnzbd, NZBGet, qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge | queue, speed | pause, resume | key or password |
| MeTube | fetch a video, downloads, download count | fetch an address you type in, save the file to your own machine, remove, try again | none; MeTube has no login of its own, so whoever reaches it may queue and delete |
| Sportarr | upcoming, missing events, events | | API key from Settings > General > Security |
| Tube Archivist | download queue, latest videos, video archive | start downloads | API token from Settings > Application, sent as Token |
| Home Assistant | entity, entity list | turn on/off, scenes, scripts, covers, locks | long-lived token; live over WebSocket |
| Uptime Kuma | monitors, summary | | API key (metrics endpoint) |
| Healthchecks | checks, checks up | | API key from the project settings; the read-only one is enough, and healthchecks.io works too |

| UPS (PeaNUT) | UPS, UPS details | | optional sign-in |
| Gotify | messages, message count | | client token (an application token may only write) |
| ntfy | messages | | topic, and a token for a protected one |
| Prometheus | query value, query list | | optional basic auth |
| Grafana | alerts, status | | service account token; needs unified alerting, so Grafana 9.0 or newer |
| JSON API | value, list | | optional bearer token |
| iCal feed | events | | feed address |
| Paperless-ngx | archive, latest documents | | API token from the user profile |
| Mealie | meal plan, shopping list, kitchen | | API token from Profile > Manage your API tokens |
| Grocy | stock to watch, pantry | | API key from Manage API keys |
| Vikunja | due tasks, tasks | | API token with read_all for tasks and projects; the time zone for "today" is a field, because a token cannot read the user's own |
| Kimai | time entries, booked time | stop a running timer | API token from Profile > API access |
| Dawarich | distance, distance by month | | API key of the account; distances follow Dawarich's hourly calculation |
| wger | weight, weigh-ins | | API key from the profile, sent as Token |
| Firefly III | money, subscriptions, budgets | | personal access token from Profile > OAuth |
| evcc | energy, charging | | none; the state is readable without a password |
| BookOrbit | reading now, recently added, library | | user and password; BookOrbit has no API keys and allows five sign-ins a minute, so the token is kept |
| Ghostfolio | portfolio, holdings | | security token of the account from Settings > Access; it is exchanged for a JWT that lasts 180 days |
| Homebox | inventory, warranties | | API key from Profile > API Keys; Homebox shows it only once |
| PhotoPrism | photo library, recently added | start indexing | app password from Settings > Account > Apps and Devices; a client access token cannot list photos |
| Tandoor Recipes | meal plan, shopping list | tick an entry off | API token from Settings > API; the scope read is enough to look, ticking off needs read write |
| Wallos | next payments, subscription costs | | API key from the profile; it goes in the body of a POST, never in the address |
| Weather (Open-Meteo), RSS feeds, Calendar, Basics | current, headlines, upcoming, clock, notes, bookmarks, iframe, app tile, host, updates, status, notices, to-do | | none; the host card reads /proc, and the machine's own when /proc and /sys are mounted under /host |
| Kubernetes | cluster, nodes, pods, deployments | | a service account token with a ClusterRole of view; nothing is written. The API server's own certificate is not trusted outside the cluster, so give HexDeck its authority or switch the TLS check off. Usage needs metrics-server, and its absence is said on the card |
| OpenWrt | router, WAN, wireless | | the router's own user and password, over /ubus, which uhttpd-mod-ubus serves and LuCI installs. A stock installation lets root read everything; another user needs a read role in /etc/config/rpcd, and the wireless card needs rpcd-mod-iwinfo |
| UrBackup | clients, backups, running now | start an incremental file backup | user name and password of a local server user; the password is folded into the hash the web interface itself sends. A server with no users yet needs neither |
| Elasticsearch | cluster, indices | | an encoded API key with the cluster privileges monitor and view_index_metadata, or basic credentials, or nothing on a cluster without security. OpenSearch answers the same calls |
| Shelly | device, outputs | switch an output on or off | none on a device without authentication; a Gen 1 device takes its admin password. Gen 2 and later use digest, which is not supported yet. Local address only, never the cloud |
| Steam | player, recently played, library | | Web API key from steamcommunity.com/dev, plus the 64-bit id or custom profile name. The profile's game details have to be public, or Steam answers an empty list |
| Minecraft | server, players | | none; the server list ping carries no credentials. Java over TCP (25565), Bedrock over UDP (19132); Java servers before 1.7 speak an older ping that is not supported |
| Hacker News | stories | | none |
| Miniflux | unread, failing feeds, feed reader | | API key from Settings > API Keys |
| Karakeep | recent bookmarks, reading list | | API key from Settings > API Keys |
| Linkwarden | recent links, links | | access token from Settings > Access Tokens |
| YouTube | videos, from your subscriptions | | none for the channel feeds; a YouTube Data API key for the subscriptions card, whose account must keep its subscription list public |
| GitHub releases | releases | | none; sixty requests an hour per address |
| Share prices | prices | | none |
| Twitch | live | | client ID and secret of an application at dev.twitch.tv |
| Wake-on-LAN | wake | wake | none; a MAC address and a network that carries the broadcast |

Adapters marked **beta** in the interface have not been confirmed against a
live instance yet. They are built against the documented API and recorded
answers; a report with the service's version is welcome.

### Texts

Everything an adapter says is English: field labels, help texts, widget names
and descriptions, and the labels of values, chips, rows and actions. The
interface translates them by their English wording from
`frontend/src/i18n/texts.de.json`; a guard in `backend/tests/test_guards.py`
fails when a new text has no German entry. Data that is not a label (names,
sizes, identifiers) passes through untouched.

A widget that draws itself from its options (clock, notes, bookmarks, embedded
page, app tile) sets `client_only=True`; the settings sheet then hides the
refresh interval. A field of type `timezone` is offered as a list of IANA
zones. `POST /api/v1/widgets/{id}/preview` runs a fetch with draft options
without saving; the settings sheet uses it for its live preview.

An app tile may follow an integration: pick one in its settings and the
tile's link and its reachability check take the integration's address on
every read, so a changed address is changed once. A link of the tile's own
still wins.

A card can be enlarged but never made smaller than its `default_size`;
`min_size` is what the server uses when it has to squeeze a new widget into
a tight spot.

## Renderers

`value`, `gauge`, `stats`, `list`, `nowplaying`, `calendar`, `text`,
`bookmarks`, `iframe`, `clock`, `weather`, `feed`, `log`, `chart`, `app`, `posters`,
`counters`, `camera`, `bars`, `ring`, `timeline`, `button`, `image`, `wol`,
`search`, `ask`, `player`, `roadmap`, `project`, `items`: thirty-one, the keys of `RENDERER_MIN` in
`backend/app/adapters/base.py`. A fetch may pick another renderer for its data through
`meta["renderer"]`; the media library card uses that for its icon row.

Images such as posters are never linked with a token in the browser: an adapter
hands out `proxy:/path`, and `GET /api/v1/widgets/{id}/image?path=` fetches it
from the service with the adapter's `image_headers`, cached for an hour. An adapter
may override `image_source(config, path, ctx)` to turn a path into another request,
for example a camera snapshot with a session token that must not be cached
(`cache_seconds=0`). Live video goes the same way: `stream_source(config, options,
ctx)` names an HTTP-FLV stream, and `GET /api/v1/widgets/{id}/stream` relays its
bytes to the browser, which plays them with Media Source Extensions. The server
relays at most twelve streams at once.

## Writing an adapter

```python
from .base import Adapter, Context, Field, WidgetData, WidgetType, base_url

class ExampleAdapter(Adapter):
    kind = "example"
    label = "Example"
    category = "monitoring"
    description = "What it shows."
    icon = "example"          # a dashboard-icons name
    fields = (
        Field("url", "URL", type="url", required=True),
        Field("api_key", "API key", type="password", secret=True, required=True),
    )
    widgets = (
        WidgetType(kind="status", label="Status", description="...", renderer="value",
                   default_size=(2, 2), refresh_seconds=30, metrics=("value",)),
    )

    async def test(self, config, ctx):
        payload = await ctx.get_json(f"{base_url(config)}/api/version", headers={"X-Api-Key": config["api_key"]})
        return f"Example {payload['version']} answers."

    async def fetch(self, widget_kind, config, options, ctx):
        payload = await ctx.get_json(f"{base_url(config)}/api/status", headers={"X-Api-Key": config["api_key"]})
        return WidgetData(primary={"label": "Load", "value": payload["load"], "unit": "%"}, metrics={"value": payload["load"]})

    def demo(self, widget_kind, options, tick):
        from . import demo as fake
        value = fake.walk("example", tick, 5, 60)
        return WidgetData(primary={"label": "Load", "value": value, "unit": "%"}, metrics={"value": value})

ADAPTER = ExampleAdapter()
```

Rules:

- Secrets are fields with `secret=True`; they are encrypted at rest and never returned by the API.
- Raise `AdapterError` (or `AuthFailed`, `Unreachable`) with an English message and a hint; the card shows both.
- `metrics` are numbers recorded for sparklines; name them stably. Two or
  more of them also give the card a **View** option that draws them all as one
  chart, so name them for a legend, not for a column.
- **A drawing is offered, not written into the adapter.** A `list` card gets
  bars by itself. For a ring, set `ring=True` on the `WidgetType` **and** have
  the fetch write `meta["ring"] = ring_of(("Blocked", 400), ("Allowed", 600))`:
  only the fetch knows what the whole is, and slices taken from `secondary`
  would add up to something that does not exist.
- `demo()` must return believable, moving data for every widget kind; a test checks that.
- Add a test with recorded answers under `backend/tests/`, using `respx`.
