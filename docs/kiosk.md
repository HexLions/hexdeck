# Kiosk displays

A kiosk link shows one board without a sign-in: for a wall tablet, a
television or a monitor in the rack room.

Board menu > Kiosk > Create kiosk link. The full link is shown once; open it
on the display. It looks like `https://deck.example.com/k/nk_…`. Once the
display is in, its address shows `/k` alone: the token waits on the display
itself, not in its browser history.

A display is where a board should fill the screen. In the board settings under Look, turn on "Fit to screen" and set the width to "Whole screen": the rows stretch so the page fills the window without scrolling, and the kiosk shows the board the same way.

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| Cycle pages | Switches to the next page every so many seconds. `0` stays on one page. |
| Dim from / until | Darkens the display during that window, e.g. 23:00 to 06:30. |
| Allow actions | Buttons on the cards work on the display. Off by default: anyone at the display could restart containers otherwise. |

The token carries no session. It can read the board, its live stream, its
icons and uploaded pictures, and nothing else. Revoke it in the same menu; the display then shows
that the link is no longer valid.

Tablets: add the link to the home screen; Fully Kiosk Browser and similar apps
keep the screen on. The board uses the dark theme on displays.
