/* The dev server for the end-to-end run, started again when it dies.
 *
 *   node tools/dev-server.mjs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5799 --strictPort
 *
 * ⚠️ Not a nicety. Measured on 09.09.2026 over eighteen full runs on Windows
 * on ARM64 with Node 25.3.0: the Vite dev server aborts in about one run in
 * five with exit code 3221226505, which is 0xC0000409, Windows' code for a
 * stack overflow. It says nothing at all first: no message, no stack, no
 * diagnostic report, nothing in the event log, and the machine had three
 * gigabytes free every time. It is a known and unsolved problem around
 * Rollup's native binding on Windows (nodejs/help#5119, reported there on
 * Node 22 as well), and nothing in HexDeck can fix it.
 *
 * What HexDeck can decide is what a test run does about it. Until now the run
 * died with the server, and it did not die honestly: the browser was still on
 * the board, so the first test reported "this card is not visible after 15
 * seconds" and every test after it reported that it could not reach the port.
 * Three hours went into that sentence once. So the server comes back, the
 * crash is written down in words, and the run carries on.
 *
 * The restarts are counted and the count is printed at the end, because a
 * crash that heals silently is a crash nobody fixes. Above RESTART_LIMIT the
 * supervisor gives up: at that point something is broken that restarting will
 * not mend, and pretending otherwise would hide it.
