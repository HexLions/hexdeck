/**
 * A line above the cards while the whole installation shows invented data.
 *
 * ⚠️ Said on the board, not only in the settings. Issue #2: a Nomad connection
 * tested fine, and its cards showed the three sample nodes, because the setup
 * wizard had switched demo mode on for everything and nothing on the board
 * said so. The way out is offered to administrators only, and not at all when
 * HEXDECK_DEMO holds the mode: the switch could not undo that.
 *
 * ⚠️ A plain paragraph, without a role. `status` is a live announcement and
 * the board has one already, the edit-mode hint; `note` is taken by the line
 * that tells a phone to arrange cards on a wider screen. With either role the
 * end-to-end tests found two and stopped, and the notice needs neither: it is
 * read where it stands.
