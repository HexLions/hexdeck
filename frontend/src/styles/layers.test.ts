/**
 * The style sheet keeps its own classes in a layer, so a utility on an element wins.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured on 12.09.2026: with every rule of app.css outside a layer, ninety
 * elements ignored a utility written on them. Tailwind 4 puts utilities in
 * `@layer utilities`, and a rule outside any layer beats every layer however
 * specific it is. The card buttons were 32 pixels with a frame instead of flat
 * 24, the password field kept its text under the eye button, and a warning chip
 * was grey. tsc, eslint and every test were green; only a browser showed it.
