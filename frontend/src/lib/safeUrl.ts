 * ⚠️ Most addresses on a board are not the operator's. A feed entry's link,

 * of a third-party service and land in an `href`. A `javascript:` address
 * there runs as part of HexDeck, with the session, on any board that shows
 * that card.
 *
 * The content-security-policy the server sends stops it in a deployed build.
 * It is not sent by the Vite server, and a reverse proxy that rewrites
 * headers can drop it, so the check belongs here as well: one rule, at the
 * place where the value becomes a link.
