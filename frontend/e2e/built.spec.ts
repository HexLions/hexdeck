/**
 * The arrangement the Docker image ships: one server, built assets, and the
 * real response headers. Nothing was testing it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The Vite dev server sets no Content-Security-Policy. Everything the real
 * policy blocks passes in front of it and fails behind it, silently, because a
 * blocked resource is not a failed request: the browser refuses it and the
 * page carries on. Nexview 0.31.0 went out with Web Push dead for exactly that
 * reason, and every test was green.
 *
 * So this file asserts on the headers themselves and on what the browser did
 * with them, not on the app's behaviour, which the other spec covers.
