"""How the installation looks: the accent colour and a style sheet of its own.

HexDeck ships one look in two brightnesses. That is enough for most, and not
enough for the people who put a dashboard on a wall and want it to match the
room. Two knobs are all it takes: the colour everything highlights with, and a
style sheet the operator writes.

⚠️ The style sheet is written by an administrator and shown to everybody, so
it is checked before it is stored. CSS cannot run code in any browser this
decade, but it can fetch: ``@import`` pulls a file from wherever it points,
which on a self-hosted dashboard is a leak, not a feature. That, and anything
that would close the tag early, is refused.
