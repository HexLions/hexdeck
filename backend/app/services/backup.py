"""Backups: writing one, packing it, and putting one back.

A copy of the database next to the database is not a backup. Both sit on the
same volume; when that dies they die together. So a backup here has two
halves: a snapshot on disk, which is a restore point for a bad migration, and
``archive()``, which hands that snapshot to the operator as a file they can
carry off the machine. Only the second one is a backup.

⚠️ **The database alone is not enough.** Every service credential in it is
encrypted, and the key is not in the database. It sits beside it in
``secret.key``. Restore a database without that file and HexDeck quietly makes
a new key, after which not one connection can be read: no Radarr, no Plex, no
mail server, and no hint as to why.

⚠️ **Which is exactly why the archive carries a password.** With the key
inside, the file is everything somebody needs.

⚠️ **AES-ZIP and not a format of our own.** A format only HexDeck can open is
useless on the day HexDeck is what broke. A ZIP opens with 7-Zip, with WinRAR
and with the Explorer, so the data stays reachable without us.
