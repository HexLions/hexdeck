"""HexDeck's own log: a file an administrator can read, filter and download.

Until now everything went to standard output and nowhere else. That is fine
on a laptop and useless on a NAS: the one question a self-hosted dashboard
gets asked is "why did this card stop working at four in the morning", and the
answer was in a container log nobody had kept.

Four levels, and the deep ones switch themselves off again. Somebody turns
tracing on to catch a problem, the problem happens, and the setting stays on
for three months writing gigabytes. The level carries an end from the moment
it is set.

⚠️ Named ``journal`` because ``services/logs.py`` was already taken by the
container log tailer, which follows *other people's* logs. These two have
nothing to do with each other and the names must not suggest they do.

Three traps, all of them learned in Nexview and all of them still true here:

* **uvicorn keeps its own logger on** ``propagate = False``. Without adding the
  handler to ``uvicorn.error`` by hand, no start-up failure and no crash from
  the server itself reaches the file. Exactly the lines somebody asks for are
  the ones that would be missing.
* **A reload adds a second handler** unless the old one is taken away first,
  and then every line appears twice.
* **The format has to survive its own change.** After an update the same file
  holds lines written by the version before it, so the parser reads the newer
  part as optional instead of refusing the line.
