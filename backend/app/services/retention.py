"""Tables that had no end, and now have one.

⚠️ Five tables grew for as long as an installation ran. Only the history and
the container log lines were ever swept. On a dashboard that is up for a year
the action log holds every button anybody pressed, the notice centre every
message ever sent, and the outage table a row per service per failure, and
none of it is ever read again. SQLite does not shrink on its own either: the
file keeps the pages, and the backup archive carries them along.

``password_resets`` had a ``prune`` written for it that nothing ever called.
