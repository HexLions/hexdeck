"""The collector: one background task per widget, polling at its own pace.

The server asks every service in the widget's interval, keeps the result in
the live state, records metrics for history and pushes the change to every
browser that shows the board. Ten open tabs cost the service one request,
not ten.

Failures back off: after repeated errors the interval doubles, up to five
minutes, and the widget shows the last error instead of stale numbers.
