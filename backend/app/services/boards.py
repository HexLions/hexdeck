    ⚠️ Two callers, two levels of trust. Provisioning reads files the operator
    put into ``data/boards/`` on the server, so it may do everything: expand
    ``${VAR}`` from the environment and create the connections the file names.
    ``POST /api/v1/boards/import`` is open to every member, and gets neither.

    Without those two rights the import was a way to read any environment
    variable of the server: a member imported a board whose connection had
    ``api_key: "${HEXDECK_SECRET_KEY}"``, and read the value straight back out
    of the connection list. That key signs every session and unlocks every
    stored secret.

    ``allow_locked`` says whether a widget may be tied to a connection the
    administrator reserved. It follows the caller, not the file.
