"""The second factor: a time code, and a way back in when the phone is gone.

⚠️ **Offered, not forced.** nexmail makes this compulsory, and rightly so: a
mail client is the place every "forgot my password" ends up. A dashboard is
not, and a wall display has nobody to type a code. So each person turns it on
for themselves, and an administrator who wants it for everybody says so once
in the settings.

⚠️ **The QR code is drawn here, in this process.** A secret handed to a
foreign QR service to be drawn is not a secret any more.

⚠️ **Kiosk links and API tokens are untouched.** They have no sign-in to put a
second step in front of, and pretending otherwise would only mean a wall
display that stops working with no way to fix it.
