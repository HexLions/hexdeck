"""The main event loop, reachable from worker threads.

FastAPI runs synchronous route handlers in a thread pool. A handler that
creates or cancels a background task must hand that over to the loop the
collector runs on; ``asyncio.create_task`` from a worker thread has no loop
and raises. Everything that starts background work goes through here.
