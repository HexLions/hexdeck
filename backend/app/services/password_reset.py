carries an address, whether the mail went out: the reply is identical. Anything
else turns this form into a list of who has an account here, which is exactly
what somebody probing a self-hosted box wants first.

so the link is not offered at all rather than offered and quietly useless.

⚠️ **Only the hash is stored.** A reset link out of a database dump would be a
way into every account at once.
