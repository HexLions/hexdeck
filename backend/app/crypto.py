"""Encryption of secrets stored in the database (API keys, passwords, tokens).

The Fernet key is derived from the installation secret with a purpose prefix,
so it can never coincide with the session signing key in ``security.py``.
The derived key is cached per process; a key file swapped on disk therefore
takes effect after a restart, which is the safer of the two behaviours: a
swapped key makes every stored secret unreadable, and the operator should see
that all at once, not one request at a time.
