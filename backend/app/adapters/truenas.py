"""TrueNAS SCALE through its current API, with the REST API v2 behind it.

TrueNAS has two APIs. The REST API under ``/api/v2.0`` is deprecated since
25.04, and on 25.10 it answers a key of a **read-only administrator** with 403
for everything, including ``system/info`` (issue #4, measured on 25.10.7). The
current API is JSON-RPC 2.0 over a WebSocket at ``/api/current``, and there
the same key reads the system, the pools and the alerts.

⚠️ **The key never goes over plain http to the current API.** TrueNAS revokes
a key the moment it arrives over ``ws://``, for good, with "Attempt to use
over an insecure transport". Measured on 25.10.7: one login over ``ws://`` and
the key was dead over ``wss://`` as well. The same kind of key sent to the
REST API over http was not revoked. So an ``http://`` address keeps the REST
API and explains what to change when that is refused; only ``https://``
speaks the current API.

⚠️ A TrueNAS older than 25.04 has no ``/api/current``. Whatever turns the
handshake down, the REST API is asked instead, which those versions accept
from a read-only key. That an older TrueNAS says 404 there is expected, not
measured; 25.10.7 said 404 for ``/api/v99``.

⚠️ **The REST API is for those older versions only.** With a full
administrator's key it still answers on 25.04 and later, and that is the
trouble. Measured on 25.10.7 on 21.09.2026: TrueNAS counts every call that
signs in over REST and raises one alert, "Deprecated REST API usage", with the
count of the last 24 hours and the addresses they came from; eight calls from
the cards read "8 times". TrueNAS 26 removes the API (its list of
deprecations). The alert only goes away at no call at all, so reading the
version over REST first would keep it alive, at 24 calls a day.

So a TrueNAS with the current API is recognised without a key: a plain GET of
``/api/current`` answered 400 ("Can Upgrade only to WebSocket"), a path that
does not exist 404, over http and over https alike, and neither moved the
count. Only a 404 there lets the REST API be asked, and what it says its
version is remains the second line, for a proxy that says 404 on TrueNAS'
behalf.
