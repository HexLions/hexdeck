"""What an import may do to a board, and what happens to what an account owns.

⚠️ Two things were true here until 07.09.2026 and should not have been:

* Replacing a board deleted its pages first and looked at what was arriving
  afterwards, so one unknown card kind emptied a board and wrote that down.
  Under provisioning that ran again every ten seconds, and the file that caused
  it was never repaired by anything.
* Deleting an account left its boards behind with no owner. They kept running,
  kept asking their services, kept answering their kiosk links, and appeared in
  nobody's list, because "mine" was false for everyone and "shared" only true
  where a share existed. Nothing in the interface could find them again.

And ``provisioning`` had no tests at all, although it is the one importer that
replaces something that already exists and the one that runs during start-up.
