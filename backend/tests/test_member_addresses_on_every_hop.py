"""An address a member typed is checked on every hop, not only on the first.

⚠️ The client hook that runs for every hop of a redirect checked the metadata
address and link-local, not loopback, because it serves connections as well,
and an administrator may point one of those at 127.0.0.1. Where a member typed
the address, in an RSS card or a reachability check, the first address got the
member rule and a redirect from a server of their own led on to 127.0.0.1
unchecked. The Wake-on-LAN card knocked on any address and sent its packet to
any broadcast address with no check at all. Found on 12.09.2026.
