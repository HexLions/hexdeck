"""What has to hold around a restore, and what runs by itself.

⚠️ Restoring is the one action in HexDeck that cannot be undone from inside
HexDeck, and until 07.09.2026 three things about it were not true:

* the safety copy of the current state was called the only way back and was
  skipped with a warning whenever it failed
* nothing stopped the collector, the reachability loop or another request from
  writing while the database file was being replaced under them
* the list of snapshots promised "newest first" and sorted by file name, where
  the kind and the version come before the timestamp

And the migrations had never once run against a database older than the build:
every test database is made by ``create_all``, which builds the finished schema
and leaves every migration with nothing to do.
