"""The demo board comes with its arrangement.

⚠️ It did not. The demo appended each card's place to the lists the session
keeps as the stored value, so the new value compared equal to the old one and
nothing was written. Every fresh setup showed each card three columns by two,
in the order it was made. Found on 10.09.2026 in the database of a fresh setup:
the Media page had eleven cards and not one saved position.
