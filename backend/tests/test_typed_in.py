"""The one action that lets somebody type the value in.

⚠️ Everything else HexDeck runs is reachable only because the card put it in
its last answer with exactly those parameters, which is the guard of 0.2.0. A
field on a card breaks that comparison by design: nobody knows in advance which
address a person will paste. The way through is not a hole but a declaration —
the adapter says which single parameter is blank and what may go in it — and
these tests are what keeps the declaration from turning back into a hole.

Written against the MeTube card, which is the only card in the catalogue with a
field, and against a demo connection, so nothing here reaches a real service.
