"""Places that had no ceiling, and tables that had no end.

⚠️ All three upload endpoints read the whole body and checked the size
afterwards. Two things were wrong with that. The memory: ``file.read()`` with
no argument loads everything. And the disk, without an account at all, because
FastAPI reads the form before it resolves the dependencies: a 30 GB multipart
part sent to ``POST /auth/me/avatar`` landed in the temp directory in full, and
only then came the 401. The comment on the limit in ``backups.py`` claimed in so
many words that this could not happen.

Five tables grew for as long as an installation ran, and ``password_reset``
had a ``prune`` that nothing ever called.

And a connection number is a bare integer inside ``Widget.options``, while
SQLite hands out the number of a deleted row again: a card kept the 7 of a
connection that was gone, and the next connection an administrator created
became connection 7.
