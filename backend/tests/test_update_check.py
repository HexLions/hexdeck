"""The one call HexDeck makes to the outside, and who may make it.

⚠️ Nothing tested any of this. The switch is off by default, and the promise
attached to it is a privacy promise: an installation that was never told to
look outside does not look outside. A test that only checked the button would
have let that promise break silently.

The other half is the button, which was refused while the switch was off. So
the administrator who deliberately keeps the daily call off, the one most
likely to want to look now and then, was the only one who could not.
