⚠️ Until 07.09.2026 this had **no test of any kind**. A grep for "oidc" over
every backend and frontend test file found two hits, both of them entries in
the list of public addresses. It is a complete sign-in, it creates accounts,
and four of the findings of that day sat inside it.

The signature check itself is pyjwt's, and it is not retested here: ``claims``
is replaced so the tests can say what the provider claimed and get on with the
