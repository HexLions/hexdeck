"""The page a kiosk link opens does not pass its address on.

⚠️ A kiosk link carries its token in the address, ``/k/nk_...``, and the page
was sent with ``Referrer-Policy: same-origin``. Every script, style and picture
that first page loaded went out with the whole address as its Referer, so the
token stood in the access log of every reverse proxy in front of HexDeck, once
per file. Found on 07.09.2026, still there on 12.09.2026.
