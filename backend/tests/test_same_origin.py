"""What may run in HexDeck's own origin, and what may not.

Three separate doors into the same room, all found on 06.09.2026:

* the icon proxy hands out SVG it fetched from a public collection, from
  HexDeck's own address, and SVG is a document that runs script
* the stylesheet an operator may set barred ``@import`` and allowed ``url()``,
  which fetches just as well
* ``HEXDECK_CORS_ORIGINS='*'`` reads like "let anyone see the public parts"
  and means "let any site the operator visits act as them"
