"""What the server does per request, and how often it does it.

⚠️ None of this is about a benchmark. Each one is a count that used to grow
with the size of the board or the length of a log file, on a machine that is
often a Raspberry Pi:

* opening a board asked SQLite two questions per checked card
* every single request read the key file off the disk and made a directory
* asking for the last 200 log lines read the whole log file into memory
* the compose file this project ships puts uvicorn straight in front of the
