"""Every place that needs the public address reads the same one.

⚠️ The address can be set in the interface or in HEXDECK_PUBLIC_URL, and five
places read it three different ways. Web Push and the rescue link read only
the environment, so an installation that set its address in the interface
signed its push messages as mailto:admin@localhost, which a push service may
refuse, and printed a rescue link to localhost. Still open in the check of
12.09.2026.
