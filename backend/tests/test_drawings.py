"""The drawings a card can be asked for beyond its own: bars and a ring.

⚠️ Both refuse rather than draw nothing, and that is what most of this file
is about. A bar chart of rows that carry "2.5 s" is a column of empty tracks,
and a ring whose slices do not add up to anything is a picture of a whole
that does not exist. Both cases look like the service stopped answering, so
the card stays what it was and the operator still sees their rows.
