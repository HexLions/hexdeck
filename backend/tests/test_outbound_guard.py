"""Which addresses HexDeck will call, and which it will not.

The server sits inside the network and reaches what a member's browser cannot:
HexDeck's own API, the router, the hypervisor. A notification channel takes an
address from any member and reports the answer back, which turned that field
into a way of asking what else is listening.

Two ranges are barred and nothing else. Private networks stay open on purpose:
a homelab dashboard that cannot reach 192.168.x is no use to anyone.

* loopback, because that is HexDeck itself and whatever else listens beside it
* 169.254.0.0/16, because it hands out the host's credentials on every cloud

Decided on 07.09.2026, after the first draft barred far more and would have
made the product worse.
