"""Where the interface used to give up quietly.

⚠️ Each of these had the same shape: something failed, nothing said so, and
whoever was in front of it had no way to tell.

* Two browsers in edit mode overwrote each other. The second save put the
  first person's arrangement back, it looked saved on screen, and after a
  reload the work was gone.
* A mistyped or withdrawn ``/api/`` address answered 200 with the whole
  dashboard page, so a client asking for JSON got HTML and a success. POST
  already answered 405, so the two methods disagreed about whether the address
  exists at all.
* After a restore into an installation with a different HEXDECK_SECRET_KEY,
  the sign-in of an account with a second factor answered 500, and pressing
  Test on a saved connection did too. That is exactly the moment somebody
  needs to get in.
* A refresh interval could be set and never taken off again.
