"""A session HexDeck opens at a service is a session it closes.

A Reolink hub lets only a handful of accounts in at once and keeps a token
for an hour. On 11.09.2026 the hub turned HexDeck away with "too many users
are signed in" after an afternoon of restarts, and the code had four ways of
taking a seat without ever giving it back: cards logging in side by side, the
Test button, a saved connection and a deleted one. The first lives in the
adapter tests; the other three are here, through the addresses a person uses.
